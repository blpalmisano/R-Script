# Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels Industry  

This paper uses the stock prices of the companies within the Oil, Gas and Consumable Fuels (OGCF) industry of the Energy sector of the S&P1500 and the indicators within that industry, to examine the linear relationship between these variables. This includes the earnings per share (EPS), book value per share (BVPS), debt to total assets (DTA) and current ratio (CR) for each company within the OGCF industry. Information regarding the stock prices of companies within this industry could be valuable for not only our research within the climate change or sustainability literature, but for investors in energy technology or innovation, or stock traders following the Energy sector of investing as well.  

Graphical techniques including both histograms and scatterplots are used in this analysis. This data has been analyzed using descriptive statistics (for scalable variables), as well as correlation and regression statistical analysis, via both Microsoft Excel and R-Script.
