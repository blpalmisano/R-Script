# ðŸŒ± Patterns in Global Gross Domestic Product, Relative to Energy Consumption  

This paper examines the prominence of renewable and nonrenewable resources in global energy consumption, and the near-direct relationship that our current global energy-mix (the product-mix of energy consumption) has with global levels of economic output. My paper questions the geo-economics of natural resources as energy sources, while shining light on the weight that energy scarcity plays in economic growth.  

The course of humanity and its standard of living goes hand-and-hand with the availability to consume resources for energy. This relationship is not entirely direct but near direct, being that the trend is stronger in some countries over others and other unmeasurable variables pertaining to time periods of (mostly unpredictable and unpreventable) economic shock.  

Because our means of energy production is currently majorly unsustainable it is thus a growing threat to our biosphere and a leading motivator of anthropogenic activity (activity by humans that imposes negative effects on the environment and climate change, both directly and indirectly).

Graphical techniques including histograms, time series plots and scatterplots are used in this analysis. This data has been analyzed using descriptive statistics (for scalable variables), as well as correlation and regression statistical analysis via both Microsoft Excel and R-Script.
