# 🇺🇸 United States Homicide Rate

A “homicide” is defined by Oxford Languages as “the killing of one person by another” and is considered one of the most heinous levels of crime committable. This evaluation uses the United States homicide rate against other social issues or indicators to examine the linear relationship between these variables. This includes the unemployment rate, level of income, obesity rate, robbery rate, suicide rate, teen pregnancy rate, as well as the completion of a high school and/or bachelor’s degree. 
Information regarding the homicide rate across the US could not only be valuable for analyzing the the social issues and economic factors that go into our understanding of predicting regional homicide rates, but for research within legal studies and other crime related fields as well.
