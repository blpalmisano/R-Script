Here you'll find my some of my more recent graduate school projects. Most of this work revolves around statistical analysis and regression models that identify factors effecting equity prices via sector, industry or campany. This work was done for learning and practice purposes with a mentor, outside of regular coursework. 

The datasets in these assignments are being utilized for practice, as they are dated and can be considered historic. 

Thanks for checking this out!
